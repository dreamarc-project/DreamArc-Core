# DreamArc-Core v5.3-Premium (GitHub Package)

This folder contains a minimal but complete layout of the
QuickLoad-Core v5.3-Premium runtime:

- `QuickLoad/` – main orchestrator YAML
- `core-modules/` – shared core logic (EmotionOverflow, ColorStory, etc.)
- `engine-modules/` – Exclude/Include engines and PromptRouter
- `syntax-os/` – syntax operating systems (YO / NA / KG / AD)
- `validators/` – three-layer validator set

All files are specification-oriented and can be extended in future
commits as the DreamArc project evolves.
